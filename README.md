Secure and Efficient Decentralized Identity Management System
This project presents a robust decentralized identity management system meticulously developed using Java and Solidity, offering a secure and flexible framework for digital identity verification and group authentication.

Key Functions:
1.Decentralized Identifier (DID) Registration: Facilitates the secure registration of individual DIDs, ensuring user control and data sovereignty.
2.Group Decentralized Identifier (GDID) Management: Enables the comprehensive management of GDIDs, encompassing:
  Secure Group Key Negotiation: Implements a sophisticated process for group key establishment among designated group members.
  GDDO (Group DID Document) On-chain Registration: Ensures the immutable recording of group identity objects on the blockchain for transparency and verifiability.
3.Advanced Group Key Generation: Leverages the power of cryptographic techniques by combining:
  Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) Signatures: For efficient and compact aggregate signatures.
  Distributed Key Generation (DKG): To enhance security and fault tolerance by preventing a single point of failure in key creation.
4ï¼ŒGDID-based Group Authentication: Provides a reliable mechanism for authenticating groups using their GDIDs, streamlining access control and verification processes.
