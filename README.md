## A Delicate Identity Management System Built in Java and Solidity

### Features:

- **DID Registration**: The system supports decentralized identifier (DID) registration.  
- **GDID (Group DID) Registration**: Enables GDID(group DID) registration, which involves group key negotiation among selected members and uploads the GDDO(Group DID Docuement) to the blockchain.  
- **Group Key Generation**: Supports group key generation through a combination of BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) and DKG (Distributed Key Generation).  
- **Group Authentication**: Facilitates group authentication using GDID.
